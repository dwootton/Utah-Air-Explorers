        "Air pollution, while already considered to be an inconvience by many, is in fact a serious threat to public safety to people around the world. Utah is no exception. According to the United Health Foundation, Utah ranks at #36, leaving significant room for improvement [[1]](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/air/state/ALL).  \n",

        "The effects of Utah's poor air quality has not gone by unnoticed-- in fact, as many as 2,000 Utahns die prematurely due to health effects caused by air pollution [[2]](https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=55686497&itype=cmsid). Although to many it may appear to be the case that the air quality is ubiquitous throughout Salt Lake county, however in reality air quality can vary significantly within distances as small as 50 meters [[3]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969712013988). As such, a campus group has focused on building and deploying dozens of low cost air pollution sensors across Salt Lake Valley. This data can be analyzed to gauge the distribution and influencing factors of air quality. The information provided by a well formed data analysis of air quality in Salt Lake City could be used to inform better public policy for reducing air pollution and improving public health of Salt Lake City as a result."
